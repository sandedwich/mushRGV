        <p>
            mushRGV is a comuunity project meant to embrace all the creative minds that have come together in the rio grande valley to form musical projects of any kind. although
            i cannot guarantee coverege of every group that exists or that has existed, i encourage you to take it upon yourself to preserve as much of the scene as possible by
            submitting an entry into our database. see the navigation bar above for details. 
        </p>

        <p>
            with time, this site will be updates with links to groups's social platforms, musical releases, and more. we strive to inform the public of the richness that our musical
            scene expresses, and we will continue to imporve the quality of which we present it.
        </p>

        <p>
            mushRGV was founded by myself, eduardo trevino, and partner, meagan reyna. we hope to shed a little more light onto the amzing talent that the rgv has produced. it is my
            mission here to gap the unintended ignorance of the scene that many people in the area seem to have.
        </p>

        <p>
            the navigation bar above has links to the four core aspects of this site. 'bands' will redirect you to a listing of all local groups that i know of (this is where user
            submissions become important!), each page providing a brief history of the band along with relevant links. 'photo gallery' will redirect you to a page containing pictures
            of local events with short descriptions. 'shows' will catalogue, in detail, all the events that i can manage to go to. this will include a written description of the 
            event's overall attendance, energy, and artistic impact and a video log to accompany it. 'venues & show curators' will redirect you to a listing of venues, bars, event spaces,
             and well established show curators that are still active. my hope with this is to promote the outreach between musical groups and the people who organize them.
