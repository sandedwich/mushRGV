                    <p>
                        the idea first came onto them by guitarist ethan nowlin. along with eduardo trevino, they set out to find
                        their third member. luckily, ed had a friend, aaron perez, who had been playing percussion for a few years. the three joined up to form the
                        first iteration of jetwad. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb3d0_2X7sU">in august 2017, the 3 planned a show in ed's backyard</a> 
                        inviting quite literally everyone in their high school 
                        marching band.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        early that following year, jetwad's line-up consisted of ethan, ed, and new drummer frank hernandez. jetwad didn't offically come onto the scene 
                        until the summer of 2018. their debut show, hosted by patrick over at TIGERSBLOOD, saw acts from good ghosts, glare, and the then touring band, 
                        tears on tape. jetwad's (not so) historic set can be found over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAzAgwa0kOk">theshark15z's channel.</a> 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        following several shows throughout the second half of 2018, jetwad released "roger, roger!". the ep consisted of 5 songs, 3 of which had been
                        written solely by frank herndandez some time before joining jetwad. 1 was written by ethan and ed, and 1 was written by ethan and frank.  
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        in march of 2019, the trio hosted their first show, dubbing it "jetfest". it saw acts from astral lotus, bison, the kleptos, and about 10 minutes
                        of the vonn shweetz before mercedes pd shut the event down. jetfest is a staple in their history as it was the culminating event of days-worth
                        of planning, great music, and witnessing the community come together. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        the rest of 2019 was spent giging around they valley. in december, jetwad released copies of "...and it too" to their crowd during a show at
                        the historic cine el rey. the work consisted of unfinished, unpolished, and raw demos.
