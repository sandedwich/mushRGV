                    <h1>Jetwad</h1>
                     
                    <p>
                        it all pretty much started with ethan and i. we'd been close friends since we were kids and in that time we bounced around a lot 
                        of curious ideas. one of them come to ethan when we were 16, and it's stuck around well into the new decade: a band! admittedly with us,
                        ideas have the tendency to <em>stay</em> ideas for much longer than we intend them to. what is now jetwad was once
                        a talentless, musicless, showless "band" named <em>blind dog</em>, and it wasn't until we were 17 that the first iteration of jetwad
                        came on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        during early jetwad, between 2017 and mid 2018, i do believe we were in the underground. jetwad was ethan, myself, and ex-drummer aaron
                        perez. we knew nothing of the local scene and spent the majority of our time catering to the few people that bothered caring. our first 
                        three shows were self-arranged and were attended solely by friends we'd met throughout the years. during this time there was a veil of 
                        cozyness in our shows that, as far as i'm aware of, has yet to be matched. our first and second show can be found on ze web.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        entering 2018, ethan and i picked up frank hernandez as our drummer. we didn't really know what to expect to be honest with you. we met 
                        the guy on bandmix, a complete stranger to the both of us, but we took a chance in meeting up with him one night in january 2018.
                        other than the first few awkward interactions that seem inevitable when meeting new people, we weren't killed, captured, or offered
                        any illicit substances. and so, after a night of twiddling with our instruments jetwad was then a 17, 18, and 22 year old. 2/3 mercedes,
                        1/3 los fresnos.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        flash forward 6 months and enter june 9th, 2018. we were fortunate enough to have patrick over at TIGERSBLOOD give us the opening set 
                        of the <a href="https://twitter.com/glaretx/status/1005581826868613122/photo/1"><em>tears on tape</em></a> (houston, tx) show. unfortunately,
                        when we agreed to play we had a setlist comprising of exactly 2 originals. the underground could care less, but here we had to haul ass.
                        with only moore head's inside me and cowboy from the city under our belt the <em>idea</em> of writing new music definitely came up. i'm sure
                        you can tell where i'm going with this.. but that idea stayed an idea until a few days before our performance, at which point it became nearly
                        impossible to do. so instead, we turned to frank, who had loads of music saved up in that little iPad of his from previous projects he worked
                        on. he wrote the songs and offered to teach them to us for the sake of having enough material to perform, which we ended up doing. all in all,
                        the show went about as well as any first show could go, and it was our introduction into the scene. footage of the show can be found on
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAzAgwa0kOk">theshark15z's channel</a>.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        following the tears on tape show we divided our time between playing shows and recording music, and in an urge to release some sort of work
                        we published "roger, roger!" in december 2018. the ep consists of 5 songs. cowboy from the city, written by ethan and frank; mental disorder, 
                        written by frank; moore head's inside me, written by the three of us; unappreciated, written by frank; noemii, written by frank.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        three months later, march 2019. at this point we'd been pretty well intergrated into the social fabric of the local scene, and we thought it 
                        be very cool to host a festival-esque event to celebrate our bands one year anniversary. i will say that we didn't want this to be just another 
                        local event, we really tried to make it an <em>experience</em> for the people who went. countless hours went into the planning of jetfest. 
                        ethan took over the decor of the show, going out to buy lights, floaties, and hang strips. frank ensured equipment was set up to record each
                        of the performing groups, and i created a pamphlet that held information about set times, bands, setlists, and more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        the rest of 2019 was spent gigging around the valley. a few weeks ago we played a show at the cine el rey in which we released "...and eat it too".
                        it's made up of demos and unfinished songs that we felt people would enjoy listening to. at the moment we only have physical copies, which is why
                        there isn't a link to it on the side-bar. if you would like to a copy of this please contact any of us through our social links.
